        <h2>How to Support Disabled People</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Use Respectful Language:</strong> Be mindful of your language when discussing disability. Use person-first language (e.g., "people with disabilities") or identity-first language (e.g., "disabled person") based on individual preferences.</li>
            <li><strong>Volunteer and Assist:</strong> Offer your time to help disabled individuals. Volunteer to assist with transportation, run errands, or provide companionship.</li>
            <li><strong>Educate Others:</strong> Educate friends, family, and colleagues about disability awareness and inclusion. Share information online or in person to raise awareness and promote understanding.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Remember, small acts of kindness and understanding can make a big difference in empowering disabled people!</p>
